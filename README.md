# HEART DISEASE & POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS

Heart disease and potential risk factors
Millions of people develop some sort of heart disease every year and heart disease is the biggest killer of both men and women in the United States and around the world. 
Statistical analysis has identified many risk factors associated with heart disease such as age, blood pressure, total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, family history of heart disease, obesity, lack of physical exercise, etc. 
In this notebook, we're going to run statistical tests and regression models using the Cleveland heart disease dataset to assess one particular factor -- maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and how it is associated with a higher likelihood of getting heart disease.
